## Anomaly Detection

32 detection rules fire automatically after analysis:

**General network**
- Port scan — single source contacting >5 IPs across >15 unique ports
- Cleartext credentials — FTP or Telnet traffic with payload
- **Password reuse** — same password observed across 2+ protocols or destination hosts
- Beaconing — connection with highly regular inter-packet timing (coefficient of variation < 0.2)
- Data exfiltration — host sending >10 MB to a non-private IP
- Suspicious ports — known C2/hack-tool ports (4444, 1337, 31337, 6666, 6667)
- **Known-bad TLS fingerprint** — JA3 hash matches a curated list of malware/C2 tool signatures (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, AsyncRAT, and others)

**OT / ICS**
- Modbus write commands (FC 5/6/15/16) — unauthorized PLC writes
- **Modbus bulk register read** (FC 3/4 with quantity >100) — large scan indicates reconnaissance
- **Modbus broadcast** (unit_id=0) — command targets every PLC on the segment
- **Modbus exception response** — illegal function/address errors indicate bad commands or failed access attempts
- DNP3 control/operate commands (Direct Operate, Select-Before-Operate, Cold/Warm Restart)
- **DNP3 unusual function codes** (FC 4 Immediate Freeze Without Reply, FC 14 Warm Restart) — evasion/persistence patterns
- S7comm Write Variable and PLC Stop / PI Service commands
- **S7 code download** (Request Download FC) — PLC logic is being modified; block type and number extracted
- EtherNet/IP CIP Write Tag / Set Attribute operations
- IEC 60870-5-104 command activation (Type IDs 45–50 with COT=Activation)
- BACnet writeProperty / reinitializeDevice / deviceCommunicationControl
- OT device communicating with an internet host
- Cleartext OT protocols (Modbus, DNP3, S7, BACnet have no encryption)
- **Multi-unit Modbus polling** (≥5 distinct unit IDs from one host) — network mapping of PLC segments

**IoT**
- Cleartext MQTT (port 1883) — credentials and sensor data unencrypted
- Telnet access to an IoT device — classic Mirai botnet vector
- IP Camera sending data to an external IP — unauthorized stream or C2
- TR-069 (port 7547) — remote management protocol frequently exploited

**VLAN**
- Host seen on multiple VLANs — non-routing host tagged with 2+ VLAN IDs; possible VLAN hopping attack
- Untagged + tagged frame mix — same host sending both untagged and tagged frames; possible native VLAN leakage
- QinQ (double-tagged) frames — 802.1ad outer tag detected; legitimate in carrier networks but a classic VLAN-hopping vector
- Cross-VLAN OT traffic — OT/ICS device communicating with a host on a different VLAN; segmentation violation
- **ARP spoofing within VLAN** — same IP seen with 2+ different MACs on the same VLAN; possible ARP poisoning or MAC flapping
- **Broadcast storm** — VLAN with >10% broadcast traffic (and >50 broadcast packets); misconfiguration or loop
- **PCP priority abuse** — end-host (Windows PC, IP camera, IoT sensor) sending frames tagged with PCP ≥ 6 (network-control priority); unexpected QoS manipulation

All anomalies are shown in the sidebar and on the node detail panel; affected nodes pulse with a coloured ring (red = high, yellow = medium).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esandeepchoudary/pcap-vis-anz.git
cd pcap-vis-anz
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note for Kali / Debian systems** — if pip complains about externally managed environments, add `--break-system-packages`:
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
> ```

## Usage

```bash
python app.py                # localhost only (default, safe)
python app.py --public       # expose to your local network — see warning below
python app.py --port 8080    # use a different port
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or your machine's LAN IP if `--public` was used).

> **Security note — `--public` flag:** This flag binds the Werkzeug **development** server to `0.0.0.0`, making it reachable from other devices on your network. The development server is **not hardened** for production use. Anyone on the same network can upload arbitrary files to this process. Use `--public` only on fully trusted, isolated networks (e.g. a dedicated analysis VLAN). For long-running or multi-user deployments, run behind gunicorn instead:
> ```bash
> pip install gunicorn
> gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 'app:app'
> ```

Upload a capture file (`.pcap`, `.pcapng`, or `.cap`, up to 1 GB) and the graph will render automatically.

## Capturing your own traffic

If you don't have a capture file handy, you can create one with `tcpdump` or Wireshark:

```bash
# Capture 60 seconds of traffic on any interface
sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap -G 60 -W 1

# Or capture on a specific interface
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```

Sample `.pcap` files are also available at [https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net) and the [Wireshark sample captures page](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures).

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_UPLOAD_FILES` | 100 | Maximum files per upload request |
| `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` | 1 GB | Maximum total upload size |

| Port | 5000 | HTTP port (`--port` flag) |

## Security & self-containment

This tool is designed for **air-gapped / offline use**:

- D3.js v7 is bundled locally — no CDN requests
- CSS uses system fonts only — no Google Fonts
- The only outbound browser request is `POST /upload` to the same origin
- PNG export uses `blob:` URLs — no third-party image host

HTTP security headers are set on every response (`Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`). The app binds to `127.0.0.1` by default so it is not reachable from the network. Pass `--public` to bind to `0.0.0.0` for LAN access — only do this on trusted networks, as the app processes potentially sensitive capture files.

Robustness hardening applied in v0.9: all API endpoints return JSON errors (including 413/404/500), captured file bodies are memory-bounded (256 MB cache), connection/host/DNS/credential-state tables are capped, download filenames are sanitised with `secure_filename`, and the session-import validator rejects non-array shapes before they reach the renderers.

## Troubleshooting

**`scapy` import error** — Make sure you installed dependencies inside the correct Python environment (or virtualenv).

**Permission denied reading pcap** — Some systems require root to read certain capture files. Try `sudo python app.py`.

**Graph is empty after upload** — The file may contain only non-IP traffic (e.g. pure Bluetooth or USB captures). The tool supports IPv4, IPv6, and ARP packets.

**Very large files are slow** — Only the first 1,000,000 packets are processed. For faster results, pre-filter with `tcpdump`:
```bash
tcpdump -r big.pcap -w filtered.pcap 'tcp or udp'
```
