/* C1: Inline explanations for each anomaly type */
const ANOMALY_EXPLANATIONS = {
  port_scan: {
    what: "A host rapidly probed many ports on one or more targets.",
    why:  "Port scanning is reconnaissance — attackers map open services before exploiting them.",
    steps: ["Verify whether the scanning host is authorised (e.g. a pentesting tool).", "Check firewall/IDS logs for blocked probe attempts.", "If unexpected, treat the source as potentially compromised."],
  },
  suspicious_port: {
    what: "Traffic was observed on a port commonly associated with malware or unauthorised services.",
    why:  "Well-known malware families use predictable ports (e.g. 4444, 6667) for C2 channels.",

  },
  beaconing: {
    what: "A host sent repeated, evenly-spaced connections (low inter-arrival time variance).",

  },
  exfiltration: {
    what: "A large volume of data was transferred to an external IP.",

  },
  dns_tunneling: {
    what: "Unusually long or numerous DNS queries suggest data is being smuggled in DNS payloads.",

  },
  unusual_ja3: {
    what: "A TLS client fingerprint (JA3) was seen that does not match known browser or tool baselines.",
    why:  "Malware often has distinctive TLS handshake parameters; an unknown JA3 hash may indicate a novel or obfuscated client.",

  },
  ot_modbus_exception: {
    what: "A PLC returned a Modbus exception response (error code).",

  },
  ot_multiunit_poll: {
    what: "One host polled many different Modbus unit IDs, suggesting device discovery.",

  },
  ot_s7_critical: {
    what: "A critical S7 command (CPU start/stop, cold restart) was sent to a Siemens PLC.",
    why:  "These commands directly control PLC execution state and can halt a process if misused.",
    steps: ["Confirm the command came from an authorised programming device (PG/PC).", "Review the maintenance schedule for any planned CPU restarts.", "Restrict S7 control functions by source IP and authentication."],
  },
  ot_s7_write: {
    what: "An S7 write to DB or I/O area was observed.",

  },
  ot_s7_code_download: {
    what: "An S7 program download was detected.",
    why:  "Downloading modified PLC code is the highest-impact OT attack vector (cf. Stuxnet).",

  },
  ot_enip_write: {
    what: "An EtherNet/IP explicit message write (set attribute) was sent.",

  },
  ot_iec104_command: {
    what: "An IEC 60870-5-104 command (type ID ≥ 45) was sent.",
    why:  "IEC 104 commands are used to control substation equipment; unauthorised commands can trip breakers or actuate switches.",
    steps: ["Verify the source is the authorised control centre.", "Cross-reference with the SCADA journal for the scheduled operation.", "Enable IEC 62351-5 authentication if possible."],
  },
  ot_bacnet_write: {
    what: "A BACnet WriteProperty command was observed.",
    why:  "BACnet WriteProperty can alter HVAC/BAS setpoints, enabling temperature, airflow, or access control manipulation.",
    steps: ["Confirm the source is a known BAS workstation or BACnet operator terminal.", "Check what object and property was modified.", "Restrict BACnet traffic to the building automation subnet."],
  },
  ot_internet_exposure: {
    what: "An OT/ICS device communicated directly with an external (internet-routable) IP.",
    why:  "OT devices should never be internet-accessible; this path is a prime attack vector for ransomware and sabotage.",
    steps: ["Immediately block the connection at the firewall.", "Identify how the route to the internet was established (misconfigured router, VPN misconfiguration).", "Assess whether any data was exfiltrated or commands were received."],
  },
  ot_cleartext: {
    what: "OT protocol traffic was observed in cleartext between segments that should be isolated.",
    why:  "Unencrypted OT traffic can be intercepted and replayed, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on industrial processes.",
    steps: ["Deploy a protocol-aware OT firewall to segment the traffic.", "Consider protocol-level encryption where supported (e.g. IEC 62351).", "Use unidirectional gateways (data diodes) for flows that only need one-way data."],

  },
  iot_telnet: {
    what: "Telnet (port 23) traffic was detected to or from a device.",
    why:  "Telnet transmits credentials and commands in plaintext; it is exploited by IoT botnets (e.g. Mirai) to spread.",
